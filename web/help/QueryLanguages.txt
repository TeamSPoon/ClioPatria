---+ RDF Query Languages

ClioPatria supports
[[SPARQL][http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/]].  It provides an
interactive service that presents the results as a human-readable HTML
table and an API that presents its result as RDF/XML or XML according
to the HTTP protocol definition for the query language.

We do not consider SPARQL adequate for creating rich semantic web
applications. SPARQL often needs additional application logic that is
located near the data to provide a task-specific API that drives the
user interface. Locating this logic near the data is required to avoid
protocol and latency overhead. RDF-based application logic is a perfect
match for Prolog and the RDF data is much easier queried through the
Prolog RDF libraries than through SPARQL.

That said, SPARQL is still useful to support clients designed for it.

SPARQL queries are translated to a complex Prolog goal calling rdf/3
to resolve edges in the graph and calls to predicates from
rdfql(rdfql_runtime) that realise constraints imposed by the `WHERE`
clause and `FILTER` clauses.

---++ SPARQL Support

SPARQL support is based on the SPARQL specification, versioned April 6,
2006.  Status:

    * No optimization of literal operations.  Because many SPARQL
    operations require type-translations that depend on the literal
    found, many of these operations are slow.  The engine
    does optimize graph expressions.
    * Incomplete value-testing, notably on xsd:dateTime
    * Incomplete ORDER BY support.  Only ascending and all values
    are compared lexically.
    * Passes current test-suite, except tests affected by the above
    or acknowledged as errornous.
